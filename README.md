# LlamaIndex - Develop LLM Powered Applications with LlamaIndex Study Repository

Welcome to my study repository for the Udemy course "LlamaIndex - Develop LLM Powered Applications with LlamaIndex." This course is an exciting journey into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their practical applications. Here, I'll be documenting my learning experiences, projects, and key takeaways as I explore the capabilities of LlamaIndex to create advanced AI-driven solutions.

## About the Course

"LlamaIndex - Develop LLM Powered Applications with LlamaIndex" is all about unlocking the potential of the LlamaIndex library to build powerful LLM applications. This course, created by Eden Marco, offers a blend of theory and hands-on projects to help you understand and implement LlamaIndex in real-world scenarios.

### What Could Learn

- **LlamaIndex Fundamentals**: Get a solid grounding in how LlamaIndex works and its architecture.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Dive into techniques like Chain of Thought, ReAct, and Few Shot prompting.
- **Data Integration**: Learn to work with vector databases such as Pinecone and FAISS.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Master this cutting-edge AI framework.
- **Building Applications**: Develop a real-world LLM-powered application from scratch, including creating chatbots and custom query engines.
- **Streamlit Interfaces**: Design user-friendly interfaces for your applications using Streamlit.

### Course Highlights

This course is not for beginners. It's designed for software engineers with some experience in Python and basic software engineering concepts. You don't need prior knowledge of machine learning, but familiarity with tools like git, pipenv, and environment variables is assumed.
